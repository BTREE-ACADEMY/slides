# Printing

```python
print("Hello World")
```

In Python, printing is how we display information to the _console_.

```
Hello World
```

---

# Comments

```python
# This line prints "hello world"
print("Hello World")

print("Hello", "World") # This also prints "hello world"
```

- Anything after a `#` is a comment.
- Comments do not affect your code in any way
- Good for jotting down notes in your code

```
Hello World
Hello World
```
