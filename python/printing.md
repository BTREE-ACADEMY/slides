# Printing

```python
print("Hello World")
```

In Python, printing is how we display information to the _console_.

```
Hello World
```

---

# Printing (Variations)

```python
# Anything in quotation marks can be printed
# without any problems
print("Hello World!")

# Numbers can be printed too
print(12345)

# You can print multiple things at the same
# time separated by a space by using commas
print("I am", 10, "years old")
```

- Numbers don't need `"`

```
Hello World!
12345
I am 10 years old
```

---

# Print without newlines

```python
print(1, end='')
print("hello", end='')
print("world")
```

```
1helloworld
```

---

# Comments

```python
# this dont do nothing
print("hello world")  # neither does this
```

- Anything after a `#` is a comment.
- Comments do not affect your code in any way
- Good for jotting down notes in your code
- You can select multiple lines and toggle comments by using `ctrl` + `/` (or `cmd` + `/`)

```
Hello World
```
