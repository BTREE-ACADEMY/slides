# Workshop

After students finish a course (such as Web, Games, and Competitions), they are often at a "having-understood" state rather than "having-mastered." At this stage, they must have time to practice and master those skillsets _before_ proceeding to the next topic.

Traditional classes are often not a good fit for this "practice" due to several reasons:

- For algorithm classes (USACO), each student will be working on a different problem set based on individual progress.
- For development classes (web and games), each student will be working on his/her project, unique from everybody else's.
- Each student requires a different amount of time to solve the same question.

As a solution, we now offer 'workshop' classes, providing an affordable and long window for students to utilize assistance from instructors while working at their own pace. These classes are best taken in-between sub-courses. Please refer to the diagrams below.

# Class Type

We offer workshop classes both in-person and online.

## In-Person

We provide an in-person workshop to local students who can commute to our Irvine office. Due to limited seats, we require students to schedule all visits in advance. Students will come into our office, get a seat and start working on his/her work under our instructor's supervision.

## Online

Students anywhere in the globe can take our online workshop instead. We limit seats so that students can receive prompt responses from available tutors and instructors. The online workshop uses Zoom, where students connect to the meeting with their speaker and mic turned off. Students can raise their hand if they have a question, and an instructor will help them as quickly as possible.

# Get help

Students can ask any topic-related questions. To list a few:

- Clarify a topic
- Provide a general guidance
- Recommend a project
- Confirm feasibility of an idea
- Provide recommended problem sets based on current progress

# Rules

Standard courtesy rules apply:

- The workshop is not a private class and is not suitable for a lengthy lecture.
- Instructors may leave for another student and come back to you after a generous time limit.
- Instructors traverse through each student so that everybody gets an equal share of opportunities.
- We limit the student pool so that each student receives an adequate amount of help.
