Choosing your first language can be difficult. Let me end your misery by saying:

> It does not matter what you choose

No matter what you choose, your time-line will go something like

1. 20 hours for &lt;your first language choice&gt;
1. 5 hours for &lt;your second language choice&gt;
1. 1 hour for all else

Of course your actual time will depend on many factors, such as your diligence, talent, the quality of guidance you get. The point is, that the time to learn your 2nd, 3rd and the 4th language is so little that you will really not waste that much time by choosing a _wrong_ language -- as long as you actually _mastered_ the first language, (which is a big **IF**, I admit).

Just know that all languages share the same CS fundamentals and are more like different English dialects. It will take some time to get used to slightly different accents and vocabs but they are essentially the same.

Having said that, here are some language recommendations and what each entails :

- Python: Easy to learn! Good for USACO Bronze but little weak for anything beyond. If in doubt, learn this first and venture into Java/C++.
- Java: Very well balanced language. Easy to learn and powerful enough for almost everything: AP CS A, USACO, Unity Games...
- C++: Harder to learn compared to other languages, but is more powerful than any other. Almost a **must** if you want to go beyond USACO Silver, but I would recommend this as your 2nd or the 3rd language.

Other considerations:

- JavaScript: Specific to web/app development. Really good for your portfolio, development, hackerthon, startup ideas
- TypeScript: This is a JavaScript add-on. Learn JS first and then come back.
- Swift: If you want to build exclusively for Apple ecosystem.
- c#: This is a Java-clone. Used to build Unity games.
- HTML/CSS: These two are NOT programming languages.
- Assembly: Don't go there.
